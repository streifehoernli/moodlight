is the subject of the {\bfseries{Electonics-\/\+Project (E\+TP)}} starting with fall term 2016 in the {\bfseries{second year of the electronics engineering curriculum}} at the School of Engineering of the Zurich University of Applied Sciences.

Colour space approximated with power L\+E\+Ds (white, amber, red, green and blue) 

L\+E\+Ds driven by HW (step-\/down converter) and microcontroller SW (written in C) 

User interface on microcontroller evalboard\+: pushbuttons to chose colour and mode, touchslider to change value and touchgecko to restart (or stop) 

Remote control over serial interface with a protocol based on command strings 

User interface as smartphone app (written in Java) which uses the serial protocol over Bluetooth 

Colours may be\+: white, amber, red, green and blue~\newline
 Colour space preferably\+: hue, saturation, lightness~\newline
 Modes could be\+: midday, sunset moodlight, submarine, doze, awake, party, yoga, ...

Board\+: Starter Kit E\+F\+M32-\/\+G8\+X\+X-\/\+S\+TK Device\+: E\+F\+M32\+G890\+F128 (Gecko)
